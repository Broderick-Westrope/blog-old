# My Blog

This repo is the source code for my software engineering blog made using the [VuePress Hope Theme](https://theme-hope.vuejs.press/). It is still a work in progress as I learn to use the template/theme properly and learn to write better blog posts.

## Discussions/Comments

The repository's Discussions are used to hold the site's comments thanks to the [Giscus app](https://giscus.app/).

## Ideas

I love learning new technologies and sharing my knowledge with others. If you have ideas for blog posts feel free to send them through, especially if they are at all related to one of my public repositories because this means I probably won't have to learn it **all** from scratch, and I can get a post out faster! :sweat_smile:
