My personal journey as a software engineer began with a childhood love for LEGO, which evolved into a passion for creating virtual worlds through games like Minecraft and platforms like Scratch, Game Maker Studio, and Unity. During my time at TAFE, I had the opportunity to delve deeper into game development and explore various aspects of the field. However, as I progressed through my studies, I began to realize that there was a vast world of possibilities outside of game development waiting to be explored.

Motivated by this newfound ambition, I made the decision to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. This educational journey provided me with a comprehensive understanding of various areas within the field, including software engineering, data structures, algorithms, and web development. As I immersed myself in this broader curriculum, I discovered a passion for the wider applications of computer science and the potential to create meaningful solutions in various domains.

This transition from game development to computer science marked a significant turning point in my career. It allowed me to embrace a more versatile approach to problem-solving and equipped me with the necessary skills to thrive in different areas of software engineering. While game development provided a solid foundation in creativity, logic, and programming, my computer science studies enabled me to tackle a wider range of challenges and explore new avenues within the ever-expanding world of technology.
