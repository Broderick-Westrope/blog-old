# The Author

The following is a question-answer style post about myself. It was very hard to write (and will probably be continually refined) but hopefully it gives some context as to how I got here, why I do software engineering, and what qualifications & experience I have when writing blog posts.

***Don't be afraid to contact me [via email](mailto:broderickwestrope@gmail.com) if you'd like to chat about software career direction. Everyone feels confused or overwhelmed at some point in their journey!***

## Personal

### Early Inspirations

***What sparked your interest in software engineering? Was there a specific event or person that influenced your decision to pursue this field?***

From what I can remember there was no specific person or event that influenced me to do software engineering. My passion came from an ongoing battle to find increasingly less restrictive ways to build using my imagination. This began with my love for [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/) and [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) as a child, followed by my game development journey with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Game Maker Studio 2](https://gamemaker.io/), and [Unity](https://unity.com/).
These are just some of the tools that let me get hands-on with code and realise that I loved the idea of the ever expanding amount of learning that tech offered, not to mention the endless possible projects I could undertake. The details are talked about more in the section on my [personal journey](#personal-journey).
