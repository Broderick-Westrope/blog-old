# The Author

The following is a question-answer style post about myself. It was quite hard to write (and will probably be continually refined) but hopefully it gives some context as to how I got here, why I do software engineering, and what qualifications & experience I have when writing blog posts.

***Don't be afraid to contact me [via email](mailto:broderickwestrope@gmail.com) if you'd like to chat about software career direction. Everyone feels confused or overwhelmed at some point in their journey!***

## Personal

### Early Inspirations

***What sparked your interest in software engineering? Was there a specific event or person that influenced your decision to pursue this field?***

From what I can remember there was no specific person or event that influenced me to do software engineering. My passion came from an ongoing battle to find increasingly less restrictive ways to build using my imagination. This began with my love for [LEGO](https://www.lego.com/) and [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) as a child, followed by my game development journey with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), [Game Maker Studio 2](https://gamemaker.io/), and [Unity](https://unity.com/).
These are just some of the tools that let me get hands-on with code and realise that I loved the idea of the ever expanding amount of learning that tech offered, not to mention the endless possible projects I could undertake. The details are talked about more in the section on my [personal journey](#personal-journey).

### Personal Journey (TODO)

***Share an overview of your life leading up to becoming a software engineer. Highlight any pivotal moments or experiences that shaped your career path.***

- LEGO
- Minecraft
- Scratch
- Web design in ICT
- Game Maker
- Unity
- TAFE
- University
- Mantel Group/Azenix

### Hobbies & Interests

***Besides coding and programming, what other hobbies or interests do you have? Do you have any unique skills or talents that complement your work as a software engineer?***

#### Camping

Despite my love for code, I thoroughly enjoy unplugging from all technology and taking a break in nature. Occasionally I will go camping with no other motive, but often I go with an activity like bouldering, hiking, etc. in mind. I've camped a range of ways but most often I'm taking my *Oztrail Nomad 2* tent and whatever else fits on my motorcycle. I find being restricted by the limited space on a motorcycle very liberating because it stops you from taking much more than you need.

#### Motorcycles

Currently, my motorcycle (2007 Honda VTR250) is my only form of transport. As I mentioned, this helps me maintain a minimal lifestyle. Motorcycles have been part of my life from a young age. My mum rode one when I was very young, and now a lot of my family rides. I repaired my current motorcycle and continue to do services on it. Although I love the creativity of software engineering, working on my motorcycle gives me a platform to be hands-on and solve problems without the need to constantly relearn it (unlike having to learn new programming languages). Another bonus is that after the initial investment into gear and courses, motorcycles are a lot cheaper (I started in 2021 right after the pandemic).

#### Bouldering

Since my first climb in 2021, bouldering has been love at first sight. Its problem solving and forward-thinking nature is akin to that of programming. As a kid I always enjoyed climbing trees, playing on gymnast rings, and rope climbing at my grandparents farm. I think that it reinforces the importance of patience and foresight before climbing that I take into my work when I have to tackle a new problem (eg. TDD). I enjoy climbing in any conditions, but climbing with friends is definitely the best. It also gives me another goal for camping trips.

#### Hiking

I enjoy hiking, especially in rainforest climates from dusk to dawn when I'm camping. Like camping, this allows me an opportunity to disconnect from technology and reset my mind. I do enjoy hiking with groups of friends, but I prefer hiking alone or with a single person because this lets me either think deeply (which I enjoy) or have a deeper conversation with a friend.

#### Meditation

Similar to hiking, camping, and motorcycle riding, meditation for me is all about letting go of the mental clutter. I feel that I have increased performance and outlook on my work after taking one of these breaks. Meditation takes the most time out of any other thing on this list. I try to do it twice daily and to really enjoy the present, no matter what has been happening.

#### Mushroom Foraging & Growing

I am fascinated by mushrooms. I enjoy occasionally growing some gourmet mushrooms to share with my family. This is all about practising patience and care (with tasty food at the end). I also enjoy foraging mushrooms with my local mushroom community to learn more about these amazing creatures, and occasionally whilst I'm hiking.

#### Mountain Biking

Although not as often as my other hobbies, I do enjoy some mountain biking. Usually this is done alongside a camping or 4WD trip, but occasionally I will travel to the Blue Mountains just to shred down the hills.

### Values & Philosophy (TODO)

***What are some core values or guiding principles that drive your work as a software engineer? How do these values shape your approach to problem-solving and software development?***

- Thorough
- Patient
- Stop & Smell the Roses
- Test Driven Development
- Convention over configuration

### Learning Mindset (TODO)

***How do you stay updated with the latest trends and advancements in the software engineering field? Do you engage in continuous learning through courses, conferences, or online communities?***

- Monthly .NET Catchup @ Azenix
- Meetups
- Reeder/RSS Feed
- Conversations

## Professional

### Education & Qualifications (TODO)

***Share details about your educational background and any relevant degrees or certifications you have obtained in the field of software engineering.***

- Left school after year 10
- Cert IV & Diploma of Programming Digital & Interactive Games
- Bachelor of Computer Science

### Industry experience

***Describe your experience working as a software engineer. Highlight notable projects or companies you have worked with, showcasing the range of technologies and domains you have worked in.***

#### Azenix

Azenix is a team within the company Mantel Group. This was where my first position was as a "Future Associate" (like a graduate software/cloud engineer). The company does consulting for a variety of industries, and my team focussed on Microsoft products. This means that most of my projects would be geared towards .NET (using C#), GitHub services, and/or Azure. The projects I have done to date are:

- NIB (Travel Insurance): Our team was tasked to build APIs using [ASP.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/aspnet) that integrated with AWS tools such as [Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html) and deployed using [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/).

### Areas of Expertise (TODO)

***What are your specific areas of expertise within software engineering? Do you specialize in a particular programming language, framework, or domain?***

- Open to all. Tried many.
- Vue 3 (Composition API)
- C#
- Unity
- .NET Core
- ASP.NET
- (Lots of microsoft) but not limited to this
- C++
- Python
- R
- Azure

### Achievements & Accolades

***Have you received any recognition or awards for your work as a software engineer? Share any noteworthy achievements that demonstrate your skills and contributions.***

Not yet, but I'll keep this updated.

### Professional Affiliations

***Are you a member of any professional organizations or communities related to software engineering? Discuss your involvement and contributions to these groups.***

Not yet, but I'll keep this updated.
